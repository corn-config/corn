# üåΩ Corn

A simple and pain-free configuration language.

[Corn](https://cornlang.dev) has been designed using inspiration from JSON and Nix to produce a language that's easy and intuitive to write, 
good for config files, and has a feature-set small enough you can learn it in minutes. 
It was born out of the following frustrations:

- JSON is not a config language, despite how often people use it as one.
- TOML is good for flat structures but gets ugly quickly with deeper objects.
- YAML is far too complex and its whitespace rules make it error-prone.
- Nix is a full-sized language and not easy to integrate.
